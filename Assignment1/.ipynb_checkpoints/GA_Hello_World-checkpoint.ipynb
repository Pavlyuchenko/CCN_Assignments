    "The aim of this program is to develop a genetic algorithm that evolves the population to have contain chromosome \"Hello World\". It does so by first generating a population of random chromosomes. After that the algorithm evaluates them by assigning fitness. That is calculated by counting how many letters did each inidividual have in common with the TARGET variable. After that, the choice of the surviving individuals is made by one of three (elitist, roulette, tournament) selections available. When the best individuals are chosen, they go through crossover, which means they mate with each other and create new offspring. These then go through mutation, which gives them a chance to randomly alter their chromosome. This process is repeated until the TARGET variable is reached."

    "### Answers to Questions:\n",
    "_(More information about them at the end of the Notebook)_\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The bigger the population, the faster the algorithm evolves. That is because there is a greater chance of having fitter individuals at the beginning as well as in each particular population, for example due to greater chance of lucky mutations.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. From my testing, the mutation seems to have a kind of bell curve distribution, as the best results are obtained around 10 % mutation rate. If the mutation rate is either too big or too small, then the genetic algorithm takes longer to evolve.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Upon leaving out the crossover function alltogether, the genetic algorithm is way slower. That is due to the fact that it only relies on a random chance of mutation, which is not very effective. The crossover function is necessary to create new offspring from the best individuals.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Without mutation, the elitist selection becomes unreasonable because it loses a lot of genetic material upon each generation. But even if I choose tournament selection, the algorithm never converges to the target. With population big enough, it would be able to eventually converge in most cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. For this kind of problem, I found the optimum to be _elitist selection_ with _10 % mutation rate_. That will definitely not be the case for all problems, because the elitist selection loses a lot of information in each generation, which may make it way worse then the other two selection methods. Ultimately, the sweet spots will vary from problem to problem."

    "The code below is used to gather some staticstics about the genetic algorithm. The aim of that is to find out the average number of generations it takes for the population to evolve to the TARGET value (in this case \"HELLO WORLD\").\n",

    "The first and most imporatant remark is, that no matter what values are changed, __elitist selection always performs the best__. After that is the tournament selection, and the worst is by far the roulette selection. It might be some implementation detail that I missed, but it's more likely that the roulette selection is just not a good choice for this kind of problem.\n",

    "Then it is clear that __the bigger the population, the faster the population evolves__. That can be seen when comparing TEST 1 and TEST 2.

    "![\"Population Size\"](pop_size.png)\n",

    "Another interesting fact is that if we only let a __lower number of individuals to mate__, the population evolves faster. That can be seen when comparing TEST 3 and TEST 1. In TEST 1, I used 15 % rate to mate, while in TEST 3 I used initially 10 %, which slightly improved the results. Then I tried 20 %, which in turn made the results slightly worse.\n",
